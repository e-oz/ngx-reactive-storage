## v2.0.1 
Angular v20 is now supported.

## v2.0.0 
### Breaking changes:
* TypeScript version 5.6+ is required. 

This library still works with Angular v16+, but if you use the strict peer dependencies setting (enabled by default) in your package manager, TypeScript version 5.6+ is only supported by Angular v19.

This is caused by a different method of importing the localForge library, and this method is required for SSR support.

### New features:
* SSR is now supported ðŸŽ‰

You no longer need to wrap storage initialization in `afterNextRender()`.

## v1.2.2
Angular 18 is now supported.

## v1.2.1
Add info about `getWritableSignal()` to README.

## v1.2.0
Method `getWritableSignal()` will not write initial value to the storage anymore.

## v1.1.2
Fix: Do not emit an observable and signal if no value is found during the initial read in the storage.

## v1.1.1
Fix types in functions overloading.

## v1.1.0
New method: `getWritableSignal()` - returns a signal that you can modify using `set()` or `update()` methods, and these modifications will also update the storage key. 

## v1.0.4
More types overloading for `getSignal()` ðŸ¤¦

## v1.0.3
Better TypeScript types for `getSignal()`, remove `SignalOptions` type (was not part of public API).

## v1.0.2
Better TypeScript types for `getSignal()` and `SignalOptions`.

## v1.0.1
Method `getSignal()` now accepts `SignalOptions` as the second argument. This allows you to set the initial value and the equality check function.

## v1.0.0
1. This library has been tested in production for a long enough time.
2. No breaking changes in the API are expected in the near future.

3. So we can indeed call it v1.0.0!

## v0.2.0
Use [BroadcastChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API) to sync changes of IndexedDB stores in multiple tabs.

## v0.1.3
More docs, more tests.

## v0.1.2

Improve documentation.
