### v1.0.3
Better TypeScript types for `getSignal()`, remove `SignalOptions` type (was not part of public API).

### v1.0.2
Better TypeScript types for `getSignal()` and `SignalOptions`.

### v1.0.1
Method `getSignal()` now accepts `SignalOptions` as the second argument. This allows you to set the initial value and the equality check function.

### v1.0.0
1. This library has been tested in production for a long enough time.
2. No breaking changes in the API are expected in the near future.

3. So we can indeed call it v1.0.0!

### v0.2.0
Use [BroadcastChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API) to sync changes of IndexedDB stores in multiple tabs.

### v0.1.3
More docs, more tests.

### v0.1.2

Improve documentation.
